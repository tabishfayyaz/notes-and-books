- You can offload heavy work to background threads but there is a limit to how many background threads you can create so eventually you'll run out of memory:

Using coroutines with memory consumption of one background thread you can perform so many heavy operations and that's what is cool about it:

- Coroutines != Thread
- Coroutines are like light-weight threads
- Like threads, coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other, and communicate with each other
- Creating coroutines is very cheap - almost free. Create thousands of them without any memory issues


```
fun main () {    // Executes in main thread
    println("Main program starts: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

    thread {    //  creates a background thread (worker thread) using lambda expression
        println("Fake work starts: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        Thread.sleep(1000)  //  pretend doing some work ... may be file upload
        println("Fake work finished: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    }

    println("Main program ends: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

    //application waits for all background threads to complete to exit the process
}
```

- Unlike threads, for coroutines, the application by default does not wait for it to complete to exit the process

The coroutine equivalent of the above:

```
fun main () {   //Executes in main thread
    println("Main program starts: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

    GlobalScope.launch {    //  creates a background coroutines that runs on a background thread
        println("Fake work starts: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        Thread.sleep(1000)  //  pretend doing some work ... may be file upload
        println("Fake work finished: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    }

    println("Main program ends: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

    //application does not wait for all coroutines to exit process so we add a fake wait
    Thread.sleep(2000)
}
```
